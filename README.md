[5:41 PM, 7/17/2025] Neha🩵: Audit Risk Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict whether a firm is fraudulent or not using historical audit data collected from the Auditor Office of India for the year 2015–2016. The classification model is trained to identify risky firms based on multiple financial and operational parameters.

📁 Dataset Information

The dataset contains one year of non-confidential data of various firms audited across different sectors. Each row represents a firm and includes multiple features such as audit scores, monetary values, and historical performance indicators.

Features in the dataset include:

PARA_A, PARA_B: Parameters derived from audit reports.

TOTAL: Combined audit score.

Sector_score: Risk score associated with the sector.…
